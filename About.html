        <h1>About Green Thumb Landscaping</h1>
        <p>
          <div class="boldAbout">Green Thumb Landscaping got its roots in one of the greenest, most
          picturesque landscapes in the world - Ireland.</div> The lush countryside of
          owner and operator John Duane's homeland is known to have "40 Shades
          of Green". Today, John employs the most knowledgeable, capable and
          hardworking team. Each member contributes their own individual talents
          and strong suits, but they all have one thing in common - commitment
          to providing customers with quality products and courteous services.
          From regular lawn maintenance and installing sandstone steps to laying
          simple pathways and designing complex custom yards, our diverse team
          has the qualifications to make your vision reality. We take pride in
          even the smallest project, and are meticulous down to the last blade
          of grass. We take a customer-first approach to everything we do. Our
          team is creative, courteous, thorough and efficient, and communicates
          every step of the way to ensure your expectations are met. Green Thumb
          Landscaping treats outdoor spaces like indoor spaces. Rocks and debris
          are picked up and removed, entertaining areas and driveways are blown
          free of dust and dead and decaying vegetation is pruned away. No clean
          up required. When the work is done, the only thing left for you to do
          is kick up your feet and bask in your picture-ready surroundings. And
          you may not even know we were there.

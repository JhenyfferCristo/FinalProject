            Our experience with Green Thumb Landscaping was awesome! They
            repaired our landscaping in St. Albert. Christopher Watson, in
            particular, was professional, polite and hardworking. He wanted to
            make sure we were happy with the job every step of the way! Thank
            you Green Thumb Landscaping for a job well done! Great job
            Christopher!

            I was very happy with the professionalism and work completed by the
            entire team from the moment we met Mike, to the fantastic office
            staff and the team who completed the job on site. It was a pleasure
            working with all of you and we are happy with the finished product
            and the timely fashion the work was completed. We were very happy
            with how our questions or inquiries were dealt with so proficiently
            and professionally by everyone.

            I have used landscapers before and they are a very professional
            group. They showed up on time, did fast work and cleaned up after
            every day. They took the time to ask me questions while ensuring
            what I wanted was completed. Great job and I would recommend this
            company.

            One time, they cut my lawn too short, it turned a bit brown, but
            they've been good ever since.

            They cut my lawn, it looks pretty good, the grass does all the hard
            work of growing though.

            Someone Toilet Papered my trees, they came and fixed it and made my
            tree look nice. It was probably those darn teenagers down the
            street.

            I would personally like to extend my gratitude to Parks Landscaping
            Limited for the incredible work they did for my yard in the
            Newcastle area. Not only did the crew work diligently to complete my
            yard in a timely fashion, they were very nice and polite and went
            out of their way to ensure everything that I asked for was done.
            They were extremely patient with the issues raised regarding some of
            the neighbours concerns. They were also always asking me if there
            was anything more they could do which made me feel that they
            genuinely wanted to do their best work. The landscaping crew as a
            whole was beyond fantastic and extremely polite and professional. In
            particular, I want to thank Matt & Jimmy (who worked on the fence
            and deck) for being outstanding employees. They not only fixed and
            addressed all of my concerns but they went out of their way to make
            sure everything was completed at a high standard. For example, I had
            mentioned a concern about the grass (even though they were not the
            ones who put it in) and the next day they brought new sod in and
            replaced the bad parts. I would also like to extend my gratitude to
            Chad, as he too went above and beyond to organize everything I asked
            for. From putting up with all of my phone calls, to following up
            with all my changes; he made sure our new yard and deck was taken
            care of. I wanted to write this letter expressing how much I
            appreciate all of the crew’s hard work, and how impressed I am with
            Green Thumb Landscaping Limited.

            Green Thumb Landscaping took charge and made my landscaping happen.
            I had no clue of how to set up my yard, but they came and gave me an
            awesome plan and executed. The city had put requirements on my
            property that needed to be met. I was unsure on how to meet the
            requirements and stay within my budget. After a brief meeting with a
            park representative they had created a plan that to fulfill the
            requirements and had booked a time to finish the job. A great thing
            when you are spending so much money is to see the crew actually
            working swiftly and not taking long breaks. Park's guys worked
            straight until dark each day to finish the job. I would totally
            recommend Green Thumb Landscaping to anyone. In fact, I did
            recommend them to a neighbour down the street. He went with Park
            because they were able to deliver a prompt and professional service.
            Thank you Green Thumb Landscaping for a job well done!

            We were very impressed. We've done a lot of work to our home and
            property and this has been by far one of the best experiences! They
            met or exceeded expectations every step of the way. The planning
            process was fun, the job started the day we'd planned for and the
            crew was fantastic, working full days until they were done, and
            touching base with me whenever there were decisions to be made (no
            matter how minor). We had a patio area put in for our fire pit,
            added walkways, pea gravel and mulch to the surrounding area and
            they levelled the lawn and put down new sod. The work was top notch.
            Even more telling of the high level of professionalism is the care
            they put into follow up. They've contacted us, come out to the house
            to take a look after the fact and actually asked for feedback to
            help them do better in the future. I wish all companies cared about
            their craft as much as the team at Green Thumb Landscaping Ltd. When
            we're ready to tackle the front yard we will definitely be working
            with them again and we would highly recommend them to others 🙂

            We are truly very pleased with the work your team has done on our
            project. Not only were the guys and gals all very pleasant and
            accommodating, they always cleaned up after themselves. Anyone who
            has hired contractors to do work knows how uncommon this trait is.
